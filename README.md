This project involves building a model, using historical data, to determine the optimum weight of the product to be shipped from each respective warehouse of an FMCG company that entered the instant noodles business two years ago.
### Supply Chain Management:
Supply chain management is the handling of the entire production flow of a good or service â€” starting from the raw components all the way to delivering the final product to the consumer. A company creates a network of suppliers  that move the product along from the suppliers of raw materials to those organizations that deal directly with users.

##  Supply chain management is crucial for several reasons:

# *Cost Minimization: 
Efficient supply chain management minimizes production costs by optimizing processes, reducing waste, and enhancing resource allocation.

# *Time Efficiency: 
The adoption of just-in-time supply chain practices ensures timely replenishment based on real-time demand, allowing for quick restocking and reduced lead times.

# *Customer Satisfaction: 
Analyzing partner data helps identify potential issues before they impact customers, preventing dissatisfaction due to delayed or insufficient product delivery.

# *Dynamic Pricing Optimization: 
Data analysis enables businesses to dynamically adjust prices, particularly for seasonal or perishable goods, improving profit margins and reducing wastage.

# *Inventory Management:
Analytical tools enhance the allocation of "available to promise" inventory, ensuring accurate order fulfillment and reducing the likelihood of errors in product delivery.

In summary, effective supply chain management enhances operational efficiency, reduces costs, and improves customer satisfaction, making it a critical component for the success of businesses in various industries.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
A Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) company entered into the instant noodles business two
years back. Their higher management has noticed that there is a mismatch in the demand and
supply. Where the demand is high, supply is pretty low and vice-versa which results in a loss in
inventory cost and ultimately loss to the company. Hence, the higher management wants to
optimize the supply quantity in each and every warehouse in the entire country.
Create a model using : Train dataset
# GOALS
The objective of this exercise is to build a model, using historical data that will determine an
optimum weight of the product to be shipped each time from the respective warehouse.
1. Focus on all steps of data science (EDA, data processing, model, evaluation, charts)
2. Highlight any trend in data, deep insight, novel steps that you take
3. Highlight next steps and improvements.
4. Apply 5 to 6 machine learning algorithms and evaluate it using Test dataset .


## My approach involves:

#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Gain insights into data distribution, identify trends, and assess relationships between features.

#Data Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess data to address missing values and ensure readiness for modeling.

#Model Development:
Apply various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) to predict optimal product weights for each warehouse.

#Model Evaluation:
Assess model effectiveness using appropriate metrics on a test dataset.

# Visualization: Create visualizations to communicate insights, feature importance, and model performance.

Conclusion and Recommendations: Draw conclusions, highlight key findings, and provide actionable recommendations to optimize supply chain operations.

This project aims to reduce inventory costs, minimize losses, and enhance overall supply chain efficiency for the FMCG company through data science and machine learning, facilitating informed decision-making.
