This project involves building a model, using historical data, to determine the optimum weight of the product to be shipped from each respective warehouse of an FMCG company that entered the instant noodles business two years ago.
### Supply Chain Management:
Supply chain management is the handling of the entire production flow of a good or service â€” starting from the raw components all the way to delivering the final product to the consumer. A company creates a network of suppliers  that move the product along from the suppliers of raw materials to those organizations that deal directly with users.

####Supply chain management is crucial for several reasons:

## *Cost Minimization: 
Efficient supply chain management minimizes production costs by optimizing processes, reducing waste, and enhancing resource allocation.

## *Time Efficiency: 
The adoption of just-in-time supply chain practices ensures timely replenishment based on real-time demand, allowing for quick restocking and reduced lead times.

## *Customer Satisfaction: 
Analyzing partner data helps identify potential issues before they impact customers, preventing dissatisfaction due to delayed or insufficient product delivery.

## *Dynamic Pricing Optimization: 
Data analysis enables businesses to dynamically adjust prices, particularly for seasonal or perishable goods, improving profit margins and reducing wastage.

## *Inventory Management:
Analytical tools enhance the allocation of "available to promise" inventory, ensuring accurate order fulfillment and reducing the likelihood of errors in product delivery.

In summary, effective supply chain management enhances operational efficiency, reduces costs, and improves customer satisfaction, making it a critical component for the success of businesses in various industries.
